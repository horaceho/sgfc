Test files
==========

tests/test.sgf
--------------

test.sgf compromises almost all errors known to SGFC.

Invoking SGFC without any parameters and input file test.sgf should yield:
55 errors and 19 warnings - 15 messages are critical.

Invoking SGFC with 'sgfc -roun test.sgf' should yield:
70 error and  11 warnings - 15 messages are critical.

Following errors cannot be tested from within the test file:

Fatal error 1: error in commandline: e.g. 'sgfc in.sgf out.sgf foo'
Fatal error 2: error in commandline: e.g. 'sgfc -x in.sgf'
Fatal error 3: could not open source file
Fatal error 4: could not read source file
Fatal error 5: not enough memory
Fatal error 7: no SGF data found: e.g. 'sgfc COPYING'
Error 9: variation nesting incomplete: add ']' to the end of test.sgf
Fatal error 26: could not open destination file
Fatal error 27: could not write destination file
Error 34: file not saved due to critical errors: e.g. 'sgfc test.sgf out.sgf'
Fatal error 48: no source file specified: e.g. 'sgfc -u'
Fatal error 49: error in commandline: e.g. 'sgfc -ld'
Fatal error 68: error in commandline: e.g. 'sgfc --enco'
Fatal error 69: error in commandline: e.g. 'sgfc --encoding=xyz123'
Fatal error 70: internal charset decoding error which cannot be handled gracefully
Warning 71: illegal byte sequence. Parse with -U option, e.g. 'sgfc -U test.sgf'
Fatal error 73: charset encoding detection went wrong
Warning 74: different charset encodings in file. Use 'sgfc -E2 test-file/mixed-encoding.sgf'
Fatal error 75: different charset encodings in file. Use 'sgfc test-file/mixed-encoding.sgf'

Every line yields one or more errors/warnings.
test.sgf is compiled in a way that error/warning x occurs in line x, e.g.
error 12 occurs in line 12.

Exceptions from this rule:
- error 10 occurs at end of file (line 69)
- line 19 yields warning 19 & 53
- line 31 yields error 31 & 35
- line 40 yields warning 29 & 40

If you want to test how robust your own application is, then try
to read in this file :-)


test-files/strict.sgf
---------------------

File to check/verify restrictive checking with SGFC.
Just calling 'sgfc strict.sgf' should yield no warnings or errors.
Calling with 'sgfc -r strict.sgf' should yield:
1 error and 9 warnings.


test-files/reorder.sgf
----------------------

File to check/verify reordering of variations with SGFC.
Calling with 'sgfc -v reorder.sgf reorder-result.sgf' results
in the variation levels of the first game tree being corrected,
but the second game tree cannot be corrected.

Calling with 'sgfc -v -z reorder.sgf reorder-result-z.sgf' results
in the same level correction as before, but in addition the
ordering of variations is reversed.


test-files/mixed-encoding.sgf
-----------------------------

This file contains different character encodings within (simple)text values.
It can safely be parsed with the E2 option. E1 fails with a fatal error,
E3 replaces the 0x00 bytes of the UTF-16 encoding with spaces (hence destroying
those text values.)


test-files/escaping.sgf
-----------------------------

This file tests escaping property values in games other than Go.
Based on Patrick NÃ¤f's test file for libsgfcplusplus.


test-files/*-result.sgf, test-files/*-output.txt
------------------------------------------------

These are captures of the console output of SGFC (*-output.txt)
and the resulting SGF files (*-result.sgf).
